# Telecom Churn Prediction 📱📉

A data science project to predict telecom customer churn and understand key factors driving customer attrition.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- GridSearchCV

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict if a customer will churn using classification models.
- Identify patterns and features that influence churn.
- Help telecom companies retain customers and reduce losses.

## 📊 Dataset
Includes customer demographics, subscription type, tenure, monthly charges, and churn status.

## ⚙️ Process Overview
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, scaled numerics.
2. **EDA**: Visualized patterns and trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
3. **Modeling**: Used Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
4. **Tuning**: Applied GridSearchCV to improve model performance.
5. **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall used to assess results.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Month-to-month contracts had the highest churn rates.
- High billing complaints and low tenure led to increased churn.
- Recommendations for retention strategies were made based on findings.

## 💡 Business Impact
- Enables proactive customer retention strategies.
- Helps reduce customer acquisition costs.
- Improves long-term revenue and customer satisfaction.

## 📂 Repository Structure
